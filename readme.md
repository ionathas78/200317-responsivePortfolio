# 02 Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

> A portfolio is a vital piece of any programmer's resume, and I didn't have one.
> It was time to fix that.

I built a web site with three basic pages (an index, a contact page, and a page
to show off a gallery of my projects) using BootStrap's mobile responsive design 
processes. It leveraged a static navbar header and a footer with adaptive content
that used media queries to shift and fit the viewer's screen size.

## Design Values

GIVEN a programmer needs a website
WHEN I show the website to someone
THEN I want it to look good on mobile
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure
WHEN I consider elements important to SEO consideration
THEN I find robust, concise design flow
